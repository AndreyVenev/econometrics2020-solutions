## Homework submission guide

1. Register with Github.
3. Team-up with your fellow colleagues to form a team for the homeworks. A team must consist of
  at least two and of up to 7 members. Note that single-member teams are generally not allowed
  and submitted solutions will not be reviewed. If you fail to find a partner, please contact
  me. Exceptions are possible only upon a _motivated_ request.
4. Open the [homework invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/g/vguWjRNd): https://classroom.github.com/g/vguWjRNd.
5. Join an existing team or create a new one.
6. Wait for your homework repository to be created and click on the link.
  Open R-Studio, create a new project from _your team's_ homework repository.
7. Open each file Problem_1.R, Problem_2.R, etc and copy the starter code for your the problems
  inside an R-studio R-script file.
8. Share questions and comments in the [issues section of the main repository](https://github.com/feb-uni-sofia/econometrics2020-solutions/issues).

9. Write your solution in the files named `Problem_1.R`, `Problem_2.R`, etc.
  Solutions in other files will be ignored and will not be reviewed.
10. Upload your solutions to github. Open your team homework repository and find the files
  `Problem_1.R`, `Problem_2.R`, etc. Click on the edit button (upper right, pencil icon). Paste your
  code in the files and click on the submit button (green button, bottom of the page). Check
  that your solution is online by examining the contents of `Problem_1.R`, `Problem_2.R`, etc.

11. In case of problems, please open an issue in the main github repository.
